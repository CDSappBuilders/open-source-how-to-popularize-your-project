Steps to make your open source project popular.

The end goal of any project should be that 
people use it.  And typically, you want it to 
be used by the most people that would benefit from it,
if they knew it existed and used it.  Basically your goal *should* be
to make your app as popular as possible. 

1) Have a useful app.
1.5a) you can distribute it to developers before it's useful or polished.
1.5b) you should distribute it to "prototype" users during the
development process, to refine your requirements and re-assess
what people actually want.

2) Make it easy to use.
   Ask for user feedback on this.  And early.

3) Try not to have too many bugs which annoy users.

4) **SEO**

This is the key.  Google can help you find users that you never could.
And is the great playing field leveler.

How to increase SEO:

4a) use the google keyword ad tool to see what the most popular "related" queries
are for your product.  Make this the name of your project.

Ex: for a project which takes "loopback" audio and captures it as a device, the following were the statistics:

waveout mix 1600
audio sniffer 390
record what you hear 12,000
virtual audio interface 320
audio loopback 1900
record speakers 12,100

audio capture 246_000
virtual audio 135_000
audio grabber 165,000

So now choose a project name that matches the most popular:
  in my case: virtual audio capture grabber device

rename your github project this, create a sourceforge project with the same name style, change its "project url" to point to yours,
create the "project site" as virtual.audio.capture.grabber.device.t28.net or the like. (t28.net is freely available on afraid.org)
You want as many links back to it as possible, esp. if it's a related conversation or the like.
Post to your blog a post "virtual audio capture grabber device" with a link just to your project.
Possibly several different posts with different common keyword combinations.
Also could blog like "competitor/alternative to xxx" with the name of some popular (pay) competitor et al.

Search for the various words that match (all of them, even low popularity), and try and post links back from there
to your project.
  Be careful to not spam, though. Use your "real" name when making blog entries, and don't make extra blog entries, just change the url you use to your site.  Be authentic/legitimate or you'll be marked as a spammer.
  If you do get marked as a spammer, then change your url to somesubdomain.yourproject.com 
  "for the first few links, try and add yourself to them" ref: http://www.lextm.com/2008/08/promoting-open-source-projects.html


make it part of your email signature (have your name link back to it, or the like).

make a facebook group page for it, get 25 people to like it so that it can be visible or the like.

Then the secret is to "keep pushing it" over time.  As people blog related things, tell them about it, et al.

Post to mailing lists that are related (or even once with each release or major release).

Create google group with the same name. Link appropriately.
Get your-name.com

TODO change the name earlier, rather than later.

Add yourself to alternative.to

Get people on facebook to "like" you or your web page

Maybe add yourself to online indexes of competitors (like dmoz or the like)

Create youtube account with name, some videos, link back to your project.

create google "project" (code) with same name, link in.

Try to have "related" sites link back to you, in their links page for example,
or have them do a blog post "about" your new site or the like.  Friends, family, anybody.

If your project is a fit, advertise it on stackoverflow questions, while extolling its virtues.  Same with various mailing lists "semi-old" threads or the like (don't do too many obviously).

Tweet about it.  That is, be social, so that tweeting means something, then show it off.

ycombinator?

has some good ideas (follow the links, too).

Basically your goal is to advertise "where your people are" (your end users).  Find
them, find a way to advertise right there.

Add tracking (google analytics works) so that you can see where more traffic is doming from and how to focus perhaps).
