Steps to make your open source project popular.

The end goal of any project should be that 
people use it.  And typically, you want it to 
be used by the most people that would benefit from it,
if they knew it existed and used it.  Basically your goal *should* be
to make your app as popular as possible. 

It is worth it to try to popularize your program.  It is worth the extra time and effort.



They say that a website is 80% propaganda 20% usefulness
If nobody knows your project exists, it doesn't matter how cool or useful
or better it is, nobody will use it, and nobody will participate in it.

So here are some ideas how.

1) Have a useful app.
1.5a) you can distribute it to developers before it's useful or polished.
1.5b) you should distribute it to "prototype" users during the
development process, to refine your requirements and re-assess
what people actually want.

2) Make it easy to use.
   Ask for user feedback on this.  And early.

3) Try not to have too many bugs which annoy users.

4) **SEO**

This is the key.  Google can help you find users that you never could.
And is the great playing field leveler.

How to increase SEO:

4a) use the google keyword ad tool to see what the most popular "related" queries
are for your product.  Make this the name of your project.

Ex: for a project which takes "loopback" audio and captures it as a device, the following were the statistics:

waveout mix 1600
audio sniffer 390
record what you hear 12,000
virtual audio interface 320
audio loopback 1900
record speakers 12,100

audio capture 246_000
virtual audio 135_000
audio grabber 165,000

So now choose a project name that matches the most popular:
  in my case: virtual audio capture grabber device

maybe add some personal flair, like "yet another" or something to make it distinct.

rename your github project this, create a sourceforge project with the same name style, change its "project url" to point to yours,
create the "project site" as virtual.audio.capture.grabber.device.t28.net or the like. (t28.net is freely available on afraid.org)
You want as many links back to it as possible, esp. if it's a related conversation or the like.
Post to your blog a post "virtual audio capture grabber device" with a link just to your project.
Possibly several different posts with different common keyword combinations.
Also could blog like "competitor/alternative to xxx" with the name of some popular (pay) competitor et al.

Search for the various words that match (all of them, even low popularity), and try and post links back from there
to your project.
  Be careful to not spam, though. Use your "real" name when making blog entries, and don't make extra blog entries, just change the url you use to your site.  Be authentic/legitimate or you'll be marked as a spammer.
  If you do get marked as a spammer, then change your url to somesubdomain.yourproject.com 
  "for the first few links, try and add yourself to them" ref: http://www.lextm.com/2008/08/promoting-open-source-projects.html


make it part of your email signature (have your name link back to it, or the like).

make a facebook group page for it, get 25 people to like it so that it can be visible or the like.

Then the secret is to "keep pushing it" over time.  As people blog related things, tell them about it, et al.

Post to mailing lists that are related (or even once with each release or major release).

Create google group with the same name. Link appropriately.
Get your-name.com

TODO change the name earlier, rather than later.

Add yourself to alternativeto.net

Get people on facebook to "like" you or your web page

Maybe add yourself to online indexes of competitors (like dmoz or the like)

Create youtube account with name, some videos, link back to your project.

create google "project" (code) with same name, link in.

Try to have "related" sites link back to you, in their links page for example,
or have them do a blog post "about" your new site or the like.  Friends, family, anybody.

If your project is a fit, advertise it on stackoverflow questions, while extolling its virtues.  Same with various mailing lists "semi-old" threads or the like (don't do too many obviously).

Tweet about it.  That is, be social, so that tweeting means something, then show it off.

ycombinator?

has some good ideas (follow the links, too).

Basically your goal is to advertise "where your people are" (your end users).  Find
them, find a way to advertise right there.

Add tracking (google analytics works) so that you can see where more traffic is doming from and how to focus perhaps).


ask your users or potential users what they would want to see 
   (and/or possibly "what would you pay money to have related to this project" since that's what would be more important to them).

don't have your project "home page" be github as then you can't track analytics

try to get past a tipping point artificially

Sit down with somebody and have them try it out (preferably while talking out loud).  The closer to your target audience
the better.  Ask for feedback (then respond to feedback and show them the fixes preferably).

In general start early, release early (but fully tested) to build your project [?]

In general start with something that "if users knew it existed, it could become popular ever" (ex "Imagine the best that could happen with your project popularity wise" to check).


You could also submit a patch to a previously existing already popular project, as a way to immediately have "your" project be popular.


If there are no google searches "near" or "close" to your idea (it's too radical or the like) then you could look for popular searches that are "near" or "related" and append them to your project name possibly, though I've never tried that.

TODO get somebody that actually has popular projects to give me the run down.

You could take over an already popular project you're interested in (or become the "3rd main developer" for it) to get some free popularity.


A few case studies: Luis Lavena took over the One click installer for ruby for windows.  Its download number was already 3 million when he took over. Instant popularity!

VLC media player does something most free players don't, which is play DVD's back right (and also most files, etc.).  They're by far the most popular sourceforge project.

Rails had some screencasts initially (and high-ish quality online tutorials) that really helped its popularity.

May want to include "free" in the name.

Do polls "what else would you like this to do? What about these ideas how important would you rate them?"

polish like beautiful code or documentation, examples, "book style" tutorials, books, all help.

keytool: use generic searches (two words'ish ?) and it will tell you what related popular searches are, so you can see the
best names to use.
  click "order by global to see which are most popular      
  you can also enter "competitor's" names as search criteria and it will tell you all related searches to them.



blog posts that make it...um...match google searches that are high for it.
  advertise as a competitor to that other fella :P


google the various, try to leave comments et al :)

alternativeto.net <add self as list of competitors>

present at conferences/fairs/local user groups et al (never tried this myself but it could help spread the word/look for collaborators/get early feedback)

advertise local newspapers (?) "local company creates x!"


This may be annoying, but if you want to attract "lay" members, you'll want a youtube video or something like that (with a person describing it or what not).
  maybe on the main page, but don't auto-play that's just too hard.

Big "free download" links.

for code projects, and a little bit other projects as well : Until you have demos/screen casts/sample programs written in it/production apps nobody knows that they *can* show interest :)

screencasts on youtube with good "appropriate" names so that it can attract google SEO/be helpful.

google +1/facebook like :)

easy way for "lay" contributors (ex: google +)

easy feedback (feedback box).
  uservoice, to allow for voting?

if you have any related projects (or perhaps any other projects at all) where you could advertise it, that could help, esp. if they're popular.

Be kind, gentle, thankful when you get user contributions.  Why not?
  have an contributors file, add people freely, tell them :)
  
"lurk" online (google alerts? stackoverflow? other related mailing lists? blog entries that get posted about
your topic?) and answer peoples' questions/point them in the right direction.

Support your product.  Why not?  Be nice to newbies.  If newbie questions are too lame, establish a FAQ so you can
redirect them easily to something that even they can understand.  

Port it to Linux if you want to have developers help you on it (and/or mac if your developer base is more on mac).
Your initial users may only be developers, anyway, so building that initial community might be good to get things started.

If there's something like rubyflow/infoq that you can submit things to, then do that.

on your website:
  make it look reasonably good.  At least one image, nothing ugly.
  extoll virtues of your product.
  extoll what makes it unique.
  big download button, right on front page.

rename your product early.

don't like some other project? maybe consider fixing that project instead of starting your own.
  * less maintenance burden for you.
  * you avoid having to popularize your project at all.
  * forking is an option, too. (and/or re-branding).

release "dev" betas earlier on, for testing, even before user betas.

pay for related newsletter, +- adwords, plead for facebook like/google +1's on your web site :)
  "follow us" on facebook...
  tweet/facebook it for releases/news/comments

mailing list same name as project.

domain, title same name as project.  At least the subdomain.

m/b domain name like netflixinstantcompetitor.com though I'm not sure if that helps or not.
  m/b subdomains with that name?
  netflixinstantfreecompeitor.com

start with a project that ("imagine the ideal of what would happen with this project") could
  ever become very popular.

just help some popular project instead of starting your own.
  or use their libraries in your project possibly

try to advertise to "your audience"
  vaguely related newsletters
  real newspapers [?]
ask people first if they like your idea (people from your potential user base)


make it easy to use/human friendly
  GUI/admin control panel.

Polish. Not the country.  Get the fine edges worked out.

have a UI. make it friendly.

Make a "lay" version that cannot be misunderstood (expert version is ok too).

Watch people using it while they talk out loud.

look past your own needs for what it should do.


submit it for reviews by cnet, etc.
  slashdot? that type of thing.

put your "name" in h1 tags, also name your movies/video with SEO friendly names
  for the true work-a-holics, here's how to try and boost your facebook page more: http://searchengineland.com/7-tips-for-boosting-seo-of-your-facebook-page-91961
    basically name the tabs well is all he says.


The reality is that you may need some GUI or some simplified means for them to access your program, and/or understand or use it more easily.
